# Cardano block data analyses
A collection of Koios queries and R scripts to analyse Cardano block data.

## Start here
In this repo you will find: 
- bash scripts to automate Koios queries used to pull required data 
- R scripts to replicate my analyses or modify them to ask different questions

## General considerations
i. In the R scripts provided the directory structure expected will be the following:

> YOUR-WORKING-DIRECTORY/data/DATAFILES

This can be modified if not suitable, but data import instructions will need to reflect the changes.

ii. The data provided in the links are there to save people time and avoid putting unneccessary pressure 
on Koios. Nonetheless, the queries used to fetch all these datasets are provided here for independent 
data generation or checking. Most of the Koios queries are well within the free tier daily limits for Koios,
but the stake data is not.


## About the analyses
The results of the analyses are presented with commentary on the Cardano Forum.
I encourage interested people to: 
- re-run these analyses, to verify them
- provide code to run them in different languages (eg Python)
- ask their own questions
